# Elevator Management System – Learning and Prototype Project

This repository contains an exploratory system created as part of a real-world proposal for an elevator services company in Germany.

The project evolved through multiple stages and was primarily used as a **learning and experimentation initiative**, while also aiming to support a potential business use case.

---

## Project background

The project originated from a real need identified within an elevator services company that managed operational information mainly through spreadsheets.

Initially, the goal was to help organize this information using a database-driven approach. A first functional prototype was created to demonstrate the idea to stakeholders.

That initial prototype was later evolved into a more structured system as part of a personal learning process.

## Project evolution

The project progressed through two main phases:

### Phase 1 – Functional prototype
- Creation of a simple prototype to demonstrate the concept  
- Focus on basic data management and workflows  
- Deployment to a free hosting platform to allow remote access  
- Multilingual interface (English, German, Spanish)  

This phase was used to validate the idea at a conceptual level.

### Phase 2 – System redesign and learning focus
- Redesign of the system with a clearer separation between backend and frontend  
- Improvement of database structure and data organization  
- Exploration of APIs and application architecture  
- Focus on learning modern web application patterns  

This second phase is represented by this repository.

## Learning objectives

The main objectives of this project were to:

- Gain hands-on experience designing a database-backed system  
- Understand how backend and frontend components interact  
- Practice working with APIs and application structure  
- Improve confidence working with databases and deployments  
- Learn by iterating on a real use case  

The project was developed with guidance and support, and its primary value lies in the learning process rather than in delivering a production-ready solution.

## My contribution

I worked on this project as a personal learning initiative. My contribution included:

- Designing and iterating on the database structure  
- Building and refining the application structure  
- Implementing basic system functionality  
- Deploying the application for remote testing  
- Iterating based on feedback and new requirements  

While the project was inspired by a real business context, it was not ultimately adopted due to organizational changes unrelated to the technical solution.

## Project status

This project is not actively maintained and is not used in production.

The deployed versions may no longer function correctly due to hosting limitations, but they remain part of the learning journey and experimentation process.

## Notes

This repository represents a completed learning cycle based on a real-world scenario and reflects growth through experimentation, iteration, and hands-on practice.

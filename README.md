# Elevator Management System  
**Full-stack learning and portfolio project based on a real-world elevator services use case**

This repository contains a full-stack web application developed as a **personal learning and portfolio project**, inspired by a real operational scenario in an elevator services company in Germany.

The system was designed to explore **modern web application architecture** while addressing common operational challenges such as managing clients, projects, personnel, sales, and reports.

---

## Overview

The Elevator Management System (EMS) was designed as a learning and portfolio project to explore how a real operational business scenario can be translated into a structured software system.

Rather than focusing only on coding, this project emphasizes:
- Business process understanding
- Functional design
- System organization
- User-oriented workflows

The application reflects common challenges faced by service-based companies, such as tracking projects, managing personnel, and maintaining operational visibility.

## System features

- User authentication and role-based access
- Centralized dashboard with operational overview
- Client registration and management
- Project tracking with status control
- Personnel management and assignment
- Structured data model designed around real operational needs

---

## Business Problem Addressed

Service-based companies often rely on fragmented tools (spreadsheets, emails, manual tracking) to manage projects and personnel.

This project explores how a single system can:
- Centralize operational data
- Reduce manual tracking
- Improve visibility of project status
- Support decision-making through structured information

The system design is based on real operational workflows rather than purely academic requirements.

---

## System Design (High level)

The system follows a simple full-stack architecture:
- Frontend for user interaction and data visualization
- Backend API handling business logic and data access
- Relational database modeling real-world entities and relationships

The focus is on clarity, maintainability, and alignment with business processes rather than advanced optimization.

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Ant Design
- Backend: Django REST Framework
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Token-based authentication
- Version control: Git, GitHub
- Deployment (prototype): Render (free tier)

---

## Project evolution

### Phase 1 – Conceptual prototype
- Rapid prototype created to validate the idea
- Focus on basic workflows and data organization
- Deployment to a free hosting platform for demonstration purposes
- Initial exploration of multilingual support (English, German, Spanish)

This phase was used to validate the concept at a business level.

### Phase 2 – System redesign and learning focus (this repository)
- Redesign with clear separation between backend and frontend
- Improved database structure and data modeling
- Development of REST APIs
- Implementation of additional modules such as reports
- Focus on maintainability, scalability concepts, and code organization

---

## Learning objectives

This project was developed to:

- Gain hands-on experience building a full-stack web application
- Practice designing and evolving a relational database
- Understand backend–frontend communication via APIs
- Apply modern React patterns and UI components
- Improve confidence working with real-world inspired systems
- Practice version control and clean project organization

The project was developed with guidance and support as part of an active learning process.

## My contribution

I developed this project as a personal initiative. My work included:

- Designing and iterating on the database schema
- Implementing backend APIs and frontend components
- Integrating authentication and navigation flows
- Developing reporting functionality
- Iterating on the system based on feedback and evolving requirements
- Managing the project codebase and version control

---

## Project Status & Limitations

This project is intended as a portfolio prototype.

Due to free-tier deployment limitations, the live backend and database may not always be available.
For this reason, the project is currently showcased using screenshots and documentation.

The focus of the project is functional design and system structure rather than production readiness.

## Future Improvements

- Re-enable full deployment with persistent database
- Complete reporting module
- Add role-based permissions in more detail
- Improve dashboards with operational metrics
- Enhance UX based on user feedback

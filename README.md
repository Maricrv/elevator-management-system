# Elevator Management System  
**Full-stack learning and portfolio project based on a real-world elevator services use case**

This repository contains a full-stack web application developed as a **personal learning and portfolio project**, inspired by a real operational scenario in an elevator services company in Germany.

The system was designed to explore **modern web application architecture** while addressing common operational challenges such as managing clients, projects, personnel, sales, and reports.

---

## Project background

This project originated from a **direct request by an employee of an elevator services company in Germany**, who identified the need for a centralized system to replace spreadsheet-based operational tracking.

The initial goal was to develop a **process improvement proposal** that could be presented to company management, demonstrating how operational information (clients, projects, personnel, and sales) could be better organized using a database-driven system instead of Excel.

During the development of the proposal, the company underwent a **change of ownership**, and the initiative was discontinued due to organizational restructuring **unrelated to the technical solution**.

After that, the project was continued as a **personal learning and portfolio initiative**, evolving into a more structured and complete full-stack system.

## Project evolution

### Phase 1 – Conceptual prototype
- Rapid prototype created to validate the idea
- Focus on basic workflows and data organization
- Deployment to a free hosting platform for demonstration purposes
- Initial exploration of multilingual support (English, German, Spanish)

This phase was used to validate the concept at a business level.

### Phase 2 – System redesign and learning focus (this repository)
- Redesign with clear separation between backend and frontend
- Improved database structure and data modeling
- Development of REST APIs
- Implementation of additional modules such as reports
- Focus on maintainability, scalability concepts, and code organization

## Learning objectives

This project was developed to:

- Gain hands-on experience building a full-stack web application
- Practice designing and evolving a relational database
- Understand backend–frontend communication via APIs
- Apply modern React patterns and UI components
- Improve confidence working with real-world inspired systems
- Practice version control and clean project organization

The project was developed with guidance and support as part of an active learning process.

## My contribution

I developed this project as a personal initiative. My work included:

- Designing and iterating on the database schema
- Implementing backend APIs and frontend components
- Integrating authentication and navigation flows
- Developing reporting functionality
- Iterating on the system based on feedback and evolving requirements
- Managing the project codebase and version control

## Project status

This project is **not in active production use**.

Development was paused after organizational changes within the company that originally inspired the initiative. The system is currently maintained as a **learning and portfolio artifact**, representing a completed learning cycle based on a real-world scenario.

Deployed demo versions may no longer be available due to hosting limitations.

## Notes

This repository reflects growth through experimentation, iteration, and hands-on practice, based on a real business-inspired use case.

It is intended to demonstrate system design thinking, full-stack development fundamentals, and the ability to translate operational needs into a technical solution.
